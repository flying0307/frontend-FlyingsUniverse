# Frontend of Flyings' Universe
This is the frontend part of Flyings' Universe project,  developed with React and TypeScript. Our frontend uses Redux for state management, Material UI for implementing the UI, and i18next and react-i18next for multi-language support.

## Installation and Local Test
To run this application locally, you first need to install Node.js and npm. Then, you can execute the following commands:

```bash
npm install
npm run start-dev
```

The first command will install all dependencies, and the second command will start the development server. You can access your application at http://localhost:3000/.

## Development
Our application utilizes module aliases, uses ESlint for code checking, and Prettier for code formatting.
